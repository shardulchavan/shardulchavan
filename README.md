### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Shardul Chavan and I am a Master of Science in Information Systems student at Northeastern University, Boston. I am expected to graduate in April 2024, and have completed relevant courses such as Data Science Engineering Methods and Tools, Database Management & Database Design, Advance Data Science and Architecture.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai, India in June 2022.

During my academic journey, I have gained valuable experience through various internships and academic projects. I have worked as a Data Analyst Intern at AI BI STREET PVT. LTD. in Mumbai, India, where I contributed to the development of deep learning models and achieved 91% accuracy on adversarial test cases.

I have also worked as a Python Developer Intern, where I investigated Particle Swarm Optimization computer techniques and applied them to optimize parameters influencing dam stability. I was responsible for executing 4 stochastic optimization algorithms to determine parameters preventing a dam from sliding and collapsing, and evaluating and communicating optimized solutions through presentations to support decision-making for customers and stakeholders.

I possess a wide range of technical skills, including programming languages such as Python, Java, SQL, R, C, HTML, and CSS, and databases such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and SQLite. I am proficient in machine learning techniques such as Regression, Clustering, XGBoost, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Time Series, and Neural Networks, and have experience working with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, spaCy, and NLTK.

In my academic projects, I have demonstrated my skills in data scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), data preprocessing, data imputation, feature selection techniques, and model fine-tuning. My projects include the development of a drowning accident detection system using deep models such as Time-Series analysis and ConvLSTM, and the development of a multilingual and text summarizing speech-enabled notepad using NLP and speech recognition.

I am also a certified Data Scientist by John Hopkins University and have completed "Power BI Essential Training" by LinkedIn Learning and "Deep Learning A-Z: Hands-on Artificial Neural Networks" by Udemy.

Overall, I am a motivated and skilled individual with a passion for data science and a strong desire to make meaningful contributions in the field.
